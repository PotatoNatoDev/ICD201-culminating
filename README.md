My python game for a school assignment.

## Assignment Instructions:
Write a program that will create a trivia game that the user will have to navigate through. Examples include “choose your own adventure”, “jeopardy”, “wheel of fortune”, “who wants to be a millionaire” but please don’t copy any of these. This is to be done individually.

Your program should utilize the basic programming concepts we have explored in this course in Python. These include: operators, variables, conditional statements and loops.

Requirements:
- A working Python program with no errors
- An individual game that is unique and not like any other person’s in the class or a copy of a game show on tv
- Comments throughout your code explaining how the code works and what the purpose of the code is
- User-friendly and fun, engaging game
- Content is interesting and covers a wide variety of topics that high-school students would know in general or would be able to navigate through.

You must let me know what game you’re going to choose and briefly describe it to me before you start coding it to ensure that no two games are the same.

This is a 15% summative project. Please complete the self and peer assessment and you will present your code to me anytime after Jan 17th, 2024.
